- 👋 Hi, I’m @Samurai-Safety
- 👀 I’m interested in figuring out this coding stuff ;)
- 🌱 I’m currently finding my way. Have an initial interest in Python and R. But this will likely change
- 💞️ I’m not looking to collaborate. That'll just end in an embarrassing mess for now. However, I may find myself asking questions to help my learning process. Apologies if you end up being on the receiving end of those
- 📫 message me here I guess
